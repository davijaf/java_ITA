Curso ITA - Orientação a Objetos com Java
## About this course

In this course, I designed even more complex programs with method and organization.

Applied the principles of object orientation and understanding through the Java language and know how to apply these principles in practice when designed and objectively facilitate the software in an intuitive way.

### The Java concepts introduced in this course include the following: basic object-oriented concepts,

* Methods such as classes,
* Objects and attributes,
* Instance and class variables;
* Responsibilities, collaborations and CRC cards;
* Unit tests,
* Use of IDE platform like Eclipse;
* Inheritance, concrete and abstract classes,
* Interfaces, access modifiers,
* Encapsulation, access methods;
* Deepening in the concepts of polymorphism,
* Overload and overlap;
* Class association, aggregation and composition;

The main principles used to organize the development of quality object-oriented programs are presented, being the principles "Tell, Don't Ask!" and "Demeter's Law".
Each concept was provided through UML diagrams.

At the end of this course, I have matured my programming skills in such a way that you can implement more complex software in JAVA language, based on the good practices practiced in this course.
